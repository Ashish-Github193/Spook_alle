	The is about a journey of a young boy through a dead alley. The player is supposed to survive throughout the whole map without being collided with any of spikes and ghost, this will lead to a final survival of that young boy.
	You can check the leaderboard in save_game/leaderboard.json (we will make UI of leaderboard in further versions)
